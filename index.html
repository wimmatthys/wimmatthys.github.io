<p>LOS ANGELES -- The Dodgers on Tuesday unveiled their 2018 uniform patch, which celebrates the franchise's 60 years in Los Angeles, and the focal point of the logo is the iconic Los Angeles City Hall.

The patch was on a personalized uniform presented to councilman Gilbert Cedillo by a contingent of Dodgers legends. They were attending a ceremony as the full city council reciprocated with a proclamation marking the anniversary of the club's move from Brooklyn.

The 10 stars around the logo's border represent the Dodgers' 10 National League pennants won in Los Angeles, and include five silver stars to denote their World Series championships since 1958. The stars have six points, signifying the Dodgers' six decades in Los Angeles.

p in Boyle Heights listening to games on my father's transistor radio. There is no greater pleasure than to have these players here today. And the contribution to the economy shouldn't be overlooked. What wine is to the Napa Valley, what [agriculture] is to the Central Valley, the Dodgers' economic engine is to the City of Los Angeles."</p>
